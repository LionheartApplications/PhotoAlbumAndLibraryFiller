# Photo Library Filler

Generates lots of images and adds them to the photo library. Useful for creating large photo libraries for testing.

## Overview

Use this app to create a large photo library for testing your PhotoKit app.

## Getting Started

Download the sample project, open with Xcode and install and run this app on your test device. Use it to generate at least 100,000 images for testing.

This app should really be used on a physical test device, since performance is very different between an actual device and the simulator. Ideally test on the oldest device that your app supports.

> This is custom version of this Apple tool, that when creating all these photos it puts them in albums with 10 photos each.
